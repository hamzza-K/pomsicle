    "From Variable": "Flag to retrieve new status value from specified variable",
    "Variable ID": "ID of variable containing the new status value",
    "Print Label": "Flag indicating whether a new label should be printed",
    "Label ID": "ID of the label template to use if printing is enabled",
    "Rule": "Rule for calculating retest and expiration dates (e.g., authored values, phase markers, execution time)",
