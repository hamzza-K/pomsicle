  "description": "Allows the user to record the net weight of one or more output containers for the current Order/Batch/Unit Procedure. Displays instructions, accepts container IDs via scan or entry, shows actual quantity, tare weight, and gross weight, and lets the user add weights to a list or record notes/exceptions.",
  "intent": "To capture and record the yield weight information of product containers into the system.",
