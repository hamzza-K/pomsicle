  "description": "Process consisting of two worksheets (Gross Weigh Initiation and Gross Weigh Completion) to capture the gross and tare weights of a material container and calculate the net dispensed weight.",

  "inputs": {
    "ContainerID": "Identifier of the container being weighed",
    "GrossWeight": "Weight of the container before dispensing (recorded in the Initiation worksheet)",
    "TareWeight": "Weight of the empty container after dispensing (recorded in the Completion worksheet)"

    "NetWeight": "Calculated difference between gross and tare weights",
    "DispenseTransaction": "Dispense transaction record sent during the Gross Weigh Completion phase"
