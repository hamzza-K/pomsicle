  "description": "Phase that enables an operator to check in materials defined in the Bill of Materials (BOM). Displays runtime instructions and a grid of materials flagged for check-in, allowing the operator to select lines, permit overage, enforce minimum quantities, and specify no‐quantity options.",
  "intent": "To verify and record the check-in of required BOM materials into the unit procedure according to author-defined flags before production steps proceed.",
  "inputs": {
    "Instructions": "Instruction text displayed to the operator at runtime.",
    "MaterialsGrid": "List of BOM materials with columns for BOM Reference Number, Allow Overage Flag, Material ID, Check-In Flag, No Quantity Flag and Material Description.",
    "SelectToCheckInFlags": "Boolean flags indicating which material rows are selected for check-in.",
    "AllowOverageFlags": "Boolean flags indicating if overage is allowed for each selected material.",
    "RequireMinimumFlags": "Boolean flags indicating if the minimum required quantity must be checked in before completion.",
    "NoQuantityFlags": "Boolean flags indicating if the material lot will be checked in as empty.",
    "ConfirmationType": "Level of signature/confirmation required when finishing the phase (None, Single, Double)."

  "outputs": {
    "CheckedInMaterials": "List of material IDs (and quantities, if applicable) that were successfully checked in.",
    "ExceptionsRecorded": "Details of any exceptions the operator recorded during check-in."

  "preconditions": [
    "Recipe author has added a Check In Material phase and configured Instructions, selected BOM materials and their flags, and set ConfirmationType.",
    "Materials are staged in the system and flagged for check-in."

    "Selected materials have been checked in and allocated to the unit procedure."

  "side_effects": [
    "May call the Exception page if the operator records any material-related exceptions."

  "example_usage": "An author configures a Check In Material phase with Instructions = 'Check in raw materials', selects BOM items RM-01 and RM-02, enables Allow Overage on RM-02, marks RM-01 as Require Minimum, leaves No Quantity unchecked, and sets ConfirmationType = 'Single'. At runtime, the operator checks both items, confirms overage for RM-02, then clicks Finish and signs off to complete the check-in."
