  "intent": "Record the duration of a process by timing from a start event to a stop event and capturing the elapsed time.",
  "inputs": {
    "Timer Name": "Name of the timer to start or stop. Arbitrary string when starting; must match an existing start timer name when stopping.",
    "Mode": "START or STOP to indicate whether to start or stop the timer.",
    "Allow Edit": "Flag indicating if the operator may edit the start or stop timestamps (0: No; 1: Yes).",
    "Display Format": "Format string for displaying elapsed time, matching an entry in the TIME_DISPLAY_FORMAT list.",
    "UOM": "Unit of measure for defining exception limits (must be time‐based for STOP mode).",
    "Message Minimum": "Minimum elapsed time value to trigger a message (optional).",
    "Message Maximum": "Maximum elapsed time value to trigger a message (optional).",
    "Comment Minimum": "Minimum elapsed time value to require operator comment (optional).",
    "Comment Maximum": "Maximum elapsed time value to require operator comment (optional).",
    "Report Minimum": "Minimum elapsed time value to trigger a report (optional).",

    "In STOP mode, a corresponding START instance for the given Timer Name must already exist."

    "In START mode, a new timer instance with the given name is created and running.",
    "In STOP mode, the timer is stopped, elapsed time is calculated and stored, and exception limits are evaluated."

    "Writes start and stop timestamps to the database; if multiple start instances exist, STOP is applied to the earliest one.",
